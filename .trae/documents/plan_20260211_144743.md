# Documentation & Port Standardization Plan

I will organize the project documentation and standardize the port configurations as requested, ensuring the system is clean and consistent on the `develop` branch.

## 1. Documentation Restructuring
I will create a dedicated `docs/` directory to manage project documentation systematically:
- **`docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`**: Detailed system introduction, business background, technical architecture, and frontend/backend tech stack.
- **`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`**: Explicit port configuration (Frontend: 3001, Backend: 8000) and API endpoint descriptions.
- **`docs/GUIDE.md`**: Development setup, dependency installation, and startup commands.
- **Update `README.md`**: Simplify the root README to serve as an entry point, linking to the detailed docs in `docs/`.
- **Cleanup**: Remove `README_LOCAL.md` after merging its valid content into the new structure.

## 2. Port Standardization
I will unify the port configurations to eliminate confusion:
- **Frontend**: Update `vite.config.ts` to fix the port to **3001** (as explicitly requested).
- **Backend**: Update `backend/app/main.py` to fix the port to **8000** (standard convention).
- **Integration**: Search and replace all hardcoded references (e.g., in `services/stockService.ts`, `HistoryView.tsx`) to point to the new backend URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 3. Dependency Management
- **Backend**: Create `backend/requirements.txt` listing all necessary Python packages (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.).
- **Frontend**: Verify `package.json` scripts match the new port configuration.

## 4. Execution & Verification
- Apply all changes.
- Restart the backend and frontend servers on the new ports.
- Verify the application runs correctly on `http://localhost:3001` and communicates with the backend on port `8000`.
- Commit all changes to the `develop` branch.
