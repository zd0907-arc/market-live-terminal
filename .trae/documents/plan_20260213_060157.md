I will implement the requested changes to the "Funds Game Analysis" module.

### 1. Frontend: Persistent Background Color (Price Change)
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/SentimentTrend.tsx`
- **Current Behavior:** The background flashes red/green on price change and then returns to transparent/default.
- **New Behavior:** 
    - Introduce a state `lastDirection` to remember the last price movement ('up' or 'down').
    - Add CSS classes for a static, faint background (e.g., `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.1)`).
    - Apply this static background based on `lastDirection` so the user can see the last trend even after the flash animation ends.
    - The flash animation will still play on top of this static color when a new change occurs.

### 2. Backend: Fix Missing Data (Pressure/Support/Tick)
**File:** `backend/app/services/market.py`
- **Current Behavior:** The `fetch_tencent_snapshot` function, which powers the real-time API, only parses basic price/volume data. It ignores the "Pressure/Support" (Ask1/Bid1 volumes) and does not calculate `CVD` or `OIB` for the frontend, resulting in 0 values.
- **New Behavior:** 
    - Update `fetch_tencent_snapshot` to parse `bid1_vol` (Buy 1 Volume) and `ask1_vol` (Sell 1 Volume) from the Tencent data (indices 10 and 20).
    - Calculate and return `cvd` (Active Buy - Active Sell) and `oib` (Total Buy Queue - Total Sell Queue).
    - **Tick Volume:** This requires comparing the current total volume with the previous one. I will add logic to fetch the latest snapshot from the database to calculate the volume difference (`tick_vol`), enabling this field as well.

### 3. Data Availability Answer
I will confirm that the Tencent interface (`qt.gtimg.cn`) **does provide** the necessary data:
- **Pressure/Support (压/托):** Available as Ask 1 / Bid 1 volumes (and up to 5 levels).
- **Tick:** Derived from the difference in "Total Volume" between two requests.
- **Other Fields:** Active Buy (Outer), Active Sell (Inner), Turnover Rate, etc.

I will proceed with these code changes upon your confirmation.
