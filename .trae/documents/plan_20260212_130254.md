I will fix the rendering artifact in the 'Combat Game' (CVD) chart where the gradient color split (Red/Green) may display incorrectly due to ID collisions when switching stocks. Then, I will provide a detailed explanation of the data source, calculation logic, and visual meaning as requested.

**Plan:**

1. **Modify** **`SentimentTrend.tsx`**:

   * Update the `linearGradient` ID to be unique per stock symbol (e.g., `id={`splitColor-${symbol}`}`) to ensure the color stop offsets are correctly recalculated for each stock's specific data range.

   * Update the `Area` component's `fill` attribute to reference this dynamic ID.
2. **Verify**: Ensure the React component compiles and the logic is sound.
3. **Explain**: detailed breakdown of the CVD metric:

   * **Data Source**: Tencent Real-time Quote Interface.

   * **Calculation**: `Active Buy (Outer) - Active Sell (Inner)`.

   * **Meaning**: Red represents Net Bullish (Cumulative Buy > Sell), Green represents Net Bearish.

   * **Correction**: Clarify that the "Green bottom" on a positive chart was a visual bug which is now fixed.
