I will optimize the refresh intervals and fix the "missing sentiment data" issue.

### 1. Data Duplication & Incremental Updates
*   **Limitation**: The Sina API (via AkShare) downloads the **full day's data** every time. It does not support incremental fetching.
*   **Safety Mechanism**: I have verified that the frontend `RealtimeView.tsx` already has deduplication logic (`processNewTicks`). It checks the last known tick against the new list and only appends strictly newer records. **Your local browser memory will NOT bloat with duplicates.**
*   **Action**: I will not change the backend fetch logic (as it's an API constraint), but I will implement the user's requested refresh interval changes to reduce the frequency of these heavy downloads.

### 2. Sentiment Data Missing (404 Error)
*   **Diagnosis**: The `curl` test returned a **404 Not Found** for `/api/sentiment`. This is unexpected because the code I "edited" previously *should* have registered this endpoint.
*   **Reason**: It is highly likely that the **backend server process (Terminal 8) has not reloaded** to pick up the changes in `market.py` and `routers/market.py`. The server is running via `python3 -m backend.app.main`, which does not always auto-reload on file changes unless run with specific flags (like `uvicorn --reload`).
*   **Fix**: I will **restart the backend server** in Terminal 8 to apply the new API endpoint.

### 3. Refresh Interval Optimization
*   **Change**: Update `RealtimeView.tsx` to provide the requested options: **1m, 5m (default), 15m, 30m**. This will significantly reduce the load.

### Execution Plan
1.  **Restart Backend**: Stop and restart the backend service in Terminal 8 to activate the `/api/sentiment` endpoint.
2.  **Verify Endpoint**: Run `curl` again to confirm it returns 200 OK.
3.  **Update Frontend**: Modify `RealtimeView.tsx` to change the refresh intervals.
4.  **Confirm**: Explain the deduplication safety and the reason for the "full download" behavior.
