# Fix 404 Error on History Trend API

The investigation reveals that the database **contains the data** (10 records for `sh600556` today), but the API endpoint `/api/history/trend` is returning **404 Not Found**. This indicates that the backend server did not correctly register the new API route during the last startup, likely due to a caching issue or the file edit not being picked up immediately.

## Plan

1.  **Restart Backend Service**: Stop and restart the backend server to ensure the latest code in `backend/app/routers/analysis.py` is loaded and the new route is registered.
2.  **Verify API**: Use `curl` to confirm the endpoint returns data (HTTP 200) instead of 404.
3.  **Confirm to User**: Once verified, inform the user that the data is present and the display issue is resolved.

## Technical Details
*   **Target**: `backend.app.main` (Python FastAPI process)
*   **Verification Command**: `curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/history/trend?symbol=sh600556&days=5"`
