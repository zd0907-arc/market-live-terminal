I will optimize the History View layout to match the compact style of the Realtime View.

### Changes to `src/components/dashboard/HistoryView.tsx`:
1.  **Layout Density**:
    *   Reduce container spacing from `space-y-6` to `space-y-2`.
    *   Reduce card padding from `p-6` to `p-3`.
    *   Reduce title bottom margins from `mb-6` to `mb-2`.
2.  **Typography**:
    *   Reduce section title font size from `text-lg` to `text-base`.
3.  **Visual Consistency**:
    *   Ensure the "30-Minute Trend", "Main Net Inflow", and "Buying/Selling Power" charts all use the new compact header style.
    *   Adjust the "Compare Mode" layout to align with the new spacing.

This will significantly reduce the vertical scrolling required and present a denser information view.
